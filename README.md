# GraphQL Server Studies

This repository contains code to illustrate areas that should have been
considered when building a new GraphQL server.

We'll go through the following sequence:
- Choosing a server framework and documenting why we chose it
- Initial setup, including a guide to setting up debi, test, lint, and editor
- Writing queries
- Writing a mutation
- Authentication
- Dealing with N+1 issues
- Context referencing
- Traditional paging
- Subscriptions
- Deferred
- TBD
